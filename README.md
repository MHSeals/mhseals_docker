# astro_dock

### Overview

This repository provides a project-agnostic ROS container workspace and host tooling for robotics development, with sensor drivers and integration for the Unity simulator in [`crane_sim`](https://github.com/1unarzDev/crane_sim). Startup uses prebuilt images from [`lunarzdev/astro`](https://hub.docker.com/r/lunarzdev/astro); application code lives in the mounted workspace and can be rebuilt independently.

The main stack uses ROS 2 Jazzy. JetPack 5 hosts use a separate Foxy image for camera compatibility. Linux, NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi, Windows, and macOS have Compose adapters; robotics hardware runs on native Linux, while desktop hosts also support development and simulation connections.

### Architecture

The `dev` service runs as `roboboat` in `/home/roboboat/roboboat_ws`, with the repository mounted as its workspace. Development containers are privileged; native Linux adapters expose `/dev` for hardware access.

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`.devcontainer/`](.devcontainer/) | Runtime images, Compose adapters, shell setup, deployment, and validation |
| [`ROS-TCP-Endpoint`](https://github.com/MHSeals/ROS-TCP-Endpoint) | ROS connection to the Unity simulator; included as a submodule |
| [`crane_sim`](https://github.com/1unarzDev/crane_sim) | Unity physics and simulated sensors; runs separately |
| `sitl` service | Optional ArduPilot simulated flight controller; AMD64 image |

Runtime images separate the host capabilities:

| Image tag | Platform / stack | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core` | AMD64 / ARM64, Ubuntu 24.04, Jazzy | General ROS development and MAVROS |
| `cuda` | AMD64, Ubuntu 24.04, Jazzy, CUDA / ZED | NVIDIA desktop development and cameras |
| `jetson-jp6-jazzy` | ARM64, JetPack 6 / L4T R36, Ubuntu 22.04, Jazzy, ZED 5.4 | Orin camera / GPU host |
| `jetson-jp5-foxy` | ARM64, JetPack 5 / L4T R35, Ubuntu 20.04, Foxy, ZED 4.0 | Xavier NX camera / GPU host |
| `sitl` | AMD64, ArduPilot | Simulated FCU |

Jetson images contain camera drivers; MAVROS is provided by `core` for a separate control host. JetPack 6 builds Jazzy from pinned sources because Jazzy's official Ubuntu packages target 24.04. Keep ROS apt repositories matched to the image's Ubuntu release. JetPack 4 / L4T R32 is unsupported, and Foxy is end-of-life.

#### Layers and host overrides

Images supply the platform dependencies; the mounted workspace supplies your application. `core` and `cuda` share [`Dockerfile.dev`](.devcontainer/Dockerfile.dev), using ROS and ZED/CUDA base images respectively. JetPack 6 separates the expensive ROS and sensor builds in [`Dockerfile.deps`](.devcontainer/Dockerfile.deps) from the user, Python environment, and runtime tooling in [`Dockerfile.jetson`](.devcontainer/Dockerfile.jetson). ROS and the ZED wrapper occupy separate cache layers, so wrapper changes can reuse the ROS build. JetPack 5 has its own compatible Dockerfile.

[`docker-compose.yml`](.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml) defines the shared services. `prebuild.sh` copies a host adapter to the ignored `docker-compose.override.yml`, which Dev Containers merges after the base file. Adapters add display sockets, devices, NVIDIA runtime settings, or immutable-host mounts as needed; The probe preserves the host hostname and maps device group IDs; Jetson detection also selects the JetPack image and DDS domain. Rerunning the probe regenerates this file, so keep persistent changes in an adapter or an additional override.

Extend the environment at the layer that owns the change: add application packages under `src/`, reusable dependencies to [`apt-packages.txt`](.devcontainer/apt-packages.txt), [`requirements.txt`](.devcontainer/requirements.txt), or the Jetson package lists, and host mounts or services to a Compose override. Add another `-f` file after the base and host adapter for project-specific settings; later files override earlier values according to Compose's merge rules. For Dev Containers, include that file in `devcontainer.json`'s `dockerComposeFile` list. `ASTRO_IMAGE` selects a custom runtime image without changing the adapter.

### Setup

Clone the workspace, including its ROS TCP submodule:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/1unarzDev/astro_dock.git
cd astro_dock
# For an existing checkout:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

On Linux, preview the host setup before applying it:

```bash
./setup.linux.sh --dry-run
./setup.linux.sh
```

The script configures host time synchronization, Docker, NVIDIA container support, scoped device rules, development tools, and the Compose adapter. It asks before each stage and supports Debian/Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, RHEL derivatives, immutable Fedora hosts, and Ubuntu Core. Use `--components clock,docker,devices,compose` to select stages, or `--non-interactive --yes` for provisioning. An NVIDIA driver must already be installed when needed.

On Windows or macOS, use `setup.windows.bat` or `./setup.mac.sh` and keep Docker Desktop running. Container GUI applications additionally need [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) on Windows or [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) on macOS, with network connections enabled. Graphics and hardware access depend on the host; use native Linux for robotics hardware.

For manual setup, install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with Compose, Node.js LTS, and the [Dev Container CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli). NVIDIA hosts also need the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. VS Code with the Dev Containers extension is optional.

Install Node.js LTS if needed; the setup scripts do not install it. Then run from the repository root on Linux, macOS, or WSL:

```bash
npm install --global @devcontainers/cli
.devcontainer/prebuild.sh
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . bash
```

On native Windows, the setup script generates the Windows adapter; install the CLI with the same `npm` command and run the `devcontainer` commands from that checkout. VS Code's **Reopen in Container** uses the same configuration after the adapter is generated.

### Usage

Add your project's ROS packages under `src/` inside the container. [`optional_repos.yaml`](optional_repos.yaml) lists additional repositories available through `./clone_optional.sh`; choose the ones your project needs. Build from the workspace root:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
help
```

Camera images already include the ZED wrapper. Only clone it when developing the driver, and match the revision pinned in the corresponding Dockerfile. On JetPack 5, use `humble-v4.0.8` with its recursive submodules; the optional clone helper defaults to `master`, which is incompatible with that image.

#### Simulation

Run [`crane_sim`](https://github.com/1unarzDev/crane_sim) on the host. Start the ROS TCP endpoint inside the container:

```bash
ros2 run ros_tcp_endpoint default_server_endpoint --ros-args \
  -p ROS_IP:=0.0.0.0 -p ROS_TCP_PORT:=10000
```

The endpoint listens on all container interfaces at port `10000`. In the simulator's ROS connection settings, use the development host's reachable address and the same port. Launch your project's ROS nodes separately, enabling `use_sim_time` for nodes that consume the simulator's `/clock`. A project launch file may already start the endpoint; start each component once.

If testing with ArduPilot SITL, start its Compose profile from a host terminal:

```bash
docker compose \
  -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml \
  -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.override.yml \
  --profile sitl up -d sitl
docker exec -it ardupilot_sitl bash
```

Inside `ardupilot_sitl`, with the Unity connection running:

```bash
Tools/autotest/sim_vehicle.py -v "$VEHICLE" $SITL_EXTRA_ARGS
```

Connect MAVROS from the development container using the TCP output configured by the SITL service:

```bash
ros2 launch mavros apm.launch fcu_url:=tcp://127.0.0.1:5762
```

If your project launch already starts MAVROS, configure that instance instead. The SITL image is AMD64; running it on ARM64 requires emulation.

#### Hardware and cameras

On physical hardware, launch your project's nodes on the hosts responsible for their devices. Disable simulation time and synchronize clocks across hosts so sensor timestamps and TF agree. Device configuration and actuator control belong to the project using the workspace.

For a standalone camera session inside a Jetson container:

```bash
ros2 launch zed_wrapper zed_camera.launch.py \
  camera_model:=zed2i camera_name:=front publish_tf:=false publish_map_tf:=false
# In another container shell:
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml
```

In Foxglove, choose **Rosbridge**, connect to `ws://<jetson-host>:9090`, and select an image topic. Inspect `ros2 topic list` because ZED 4 and 5 topic names differ. Keep the unauthenticated connection on a trusted LAN.

Foxy uses DDS domain **142**; Jazzy uses **42**. Keep them separate: matching their domain IDs can cause discovery failures and crashes. Use an explicit cross-version bridge for shared data. Jazzy RViz cannot directly view the Foxy camera stream; use Foxglove or a matching Foxy environment. `ASTRO_ROS_DOMAIN_ID` overrides the Jetson default for networks with compatible peers.

For device access problems, run `.devcontainer/device-diagnostics.sh` on the host and inside the container to compare access. Reapply `./setup.linux.sh --components devices` after a JetPack upgrade if permissions change. Use scoped device rules rather than recursive permission changes under `/dev`.

Containers share the host clock. For an isolated network with a reachable NTP server, configure it on each Linux host before running timestamp-sensitive nodes or package updates:

```bash
ASTRO_NTP_SERVER=192.168.0.185 ./setup.linux.sh --components clock
timedatectl status
```

Replace the address with your network's time server. [`.devcontainer/Dockerfile.time-server`](.devcontainer/Dockerfile.time-server) and [`time-server.conf`](.devcontainer/time-server.conf) provide a chrony relay for an internet-connected Linux host; adjust the allowed subnet before using it. Offline hosts need an available time source or battery-backed RTC. Stop control nodes and actuators before clock steps.

#### Router and internet sharing

[`router_setup.sh`](router_setup.sh) configures a DD-WRT router over SSH for a LAN whose internet gateway is a connected laptop. By default, the router is `192.168.0.1`, the laptop is `192.168.0.2`, and DHCP clients use the laptop as their gateway. The script configures DHCP, DNS, and WPA2 Wi-Fi, disables router WAN/NAT, and connects devices through normal LAN ports. Addresses, SSID, and credentials are prompted during setup.

```bash
./router_setup.sh --dry-run
./router_setup.sh
```

The preview connects and inspects without changing router settings. Applying requires confirmation, saves an NVRAM backup when supported, reboots, and verifies the configuration. SSH keys, trusted host keys, and backups live in the ignored `router_setup_state/` directory; the menu also provides backup restoration.

On the Linux gateway laptop, [`shared_internet.sh`](shared_internet.sh) detects an internet-connected interface, adjusts its default route, enables IPv4 forwarding, and adds NAT/forwarding rules for `192.168.0.0/24`:

```bash
./shared_internet.sh
```

First give the laptop's LAN interface the gateway address advertised by DHCP and connect a separate internet uplink. Review the script before running it: the subnet is fixed, rules are appended on each run, and persistence expects `/etc/iptables/iptables.rules` and an `iptables` systemd service. Adapt these to the host distribution and subnet. Check internet access from a LAN client afterward.

#### Remote work

[`cx`](https://github.com/1unarzDev/cx) is a recommended companion for working remotely with `astro_dock` on a robot. It provides SSH device management, persistent terminal sessions, file browsing/transfers, and access through an enrolled gateway. It runs on Linux AMD64 and ARM64.

After installing `cx` and preparing the execution host as described in its README, enroll the robot:

```bash
cx add user@robot-host
# If the robot is reachable through an enrolled laptop:
cx add user@robot-host --via laptop
cx
```

Open a terminal or persistent shell on the robot host, change to its `astro_dock` checkout, and use `devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . bash` to enter the ROS workspace. Managed sessions keep running when the viewer disconnects. The router and sharing scripts provide network access; `cx` uses that access for remote work.

#### Refresh and stop

Compose pulls missing images while allowing Dev Containers to use its local UID-adjusted image. To refresh published images, run this from the host before reopening the container:

```bash
docker compose \
  -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml \
  -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.override.yml \
  pull dev
```

Keep `ASTRO_PULL_POLICY=missing` during Dev Containers startup; `always` attempts to pull the locally generated UID image from the registry. To stop and remove the services, use the same Compose files with `down`.

### Development

Develop application packages inside the container. After adding packages or changing their manifests, install workspace dependencies explicitly, then build and test the affected packages. Replace `your_package` with your package name:

```bash
ASTRO_ROSDEP_INSTALL=1 .devcontainer/postcreate.sh
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select your_package
source install/setup.bash
colcon test --packages-select your_package
colcon test-result --verbose
```

On either Jetson image, `sudo -E astro-ros-install <package>` installs a ROS package using distro packages where available and source builds otherwise. Source additions live in `/opt/astro-extra`; open a new shell afterward. To persist additions across recreation, add package names to [`jetson-jp5-packages.txt`](.devcontainer/jetson-jp5-packages.txt) or [`jetson-jp6-packages.txt`](.devcontainer/jetson-jp6-packages.txt) and rebuild the image.

For a local `core` image build, add the build override from the host:

```bash
docker compose \
  -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml \
  -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.override.yml \
  -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.build.yml \
  build dev
```

This builds `core`; Jetson images use their platform-specific Dockerfiles. Source-built Jazzy dependencies are locked in [`ros2-jazzy.lock.repos`](.devcontainer/ros2-jazzy.lock.repos). Use `lock-repos.py` to regenerate the lock and `check-dependency-lock.py` to verify it, reviewing the `rcutils` compatibility pin when updating dependencies.

#### Image publishing and deployment

[The image workflow](.github/workflows/images.yml) builds `core` on native hosted AMD64 and ARM64 runners, smoke-tests both, and combines them into a multi-architecture tag. `cuda` and `sitl` use hosted AMD64 runners. JetPack 6 builds `deps` and the runtime candidate on hosted ARM64; its dependency content key skips an unchanged foundation, and registry caching preserves intermediate layers. `deps` is an internal build layer. [JetPack 5](.github/workflows/jetson-jp5.yml) builds independently on hosted ARM64. Image compilation uses native runners rather than QEMU.

For a persistent ARM64 build server, register a GitHub runner with `self-hosted`, `linux`, `ARM64`, and `arm64-builder` labels, then dispatch the image workflow with `arm64_builder=self-hosted`. This switches the JetPack 6 jobs; normal automatic builds use hosted runners. Publishing requires `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secrets, with Read, Write, and Delete access for retention. [Pull-request checks](.github/workflows/container-checks.yml) validate adapters, scripts, dependency locks, and image policy, then build `core` without publishing.

Runtime tags select the current validated image, with `-prev` and `-old` retaining two rollback generations. `-next` and candidate slots are staging references. JetPack 6 candidates require hardware validation before promotion; use the immutable digest from the Actions summary on a JetPack 6 host, replacing `DIGEST` below:

```bash
.devcontainer/boat-validate.sh lunarzdev/astro@sha256:DIGEST
# After reviewing validation, promote that candidate with Docker credentials:
.devcontainer/boat-validate.sh --promote lunarzdev/astro@sha256:DIGEST
```

Validation checks the container user, ROS, non-root CUDA, and live camera messages. Promotion repeats validation and rotates the JetPack 6 release tags only after it passes. Stop any existing camera publisher before validation.

For standalone deployment on either Jetson generation, use the matching runtime image:

```bash
.devcontainer/deploy-jetson.sh lunarzdev/astro:jetson-jp6-jazzy "$PWD"
.devcontainer/validate-jetson-runtime.sh roboboat_dev
docker exec -it roboboat_dev bash
```

Use `jetson-jp5-foxy` on R35. The deploy script checks architecture and JetPack compatibility and refuses to replace an existing `roboboat_dev`. For offline deployment, transfer an ARM64 image with `docker save` / `docker load`; deployment reuses the loaded image.

The [retention workflow](.github/workflows/registry-retention.yml) keeps bounded candidate slots and release history. Inspect registry state without mutations using `.devcontainer/registry-retention.py --repository lunarzdev/astro audit`.

Keep changes scoped, explain their purpose and validation in the pull request, and update this README when setup, usage, or architecture changes. Run ROS probes in an isolated container/domain without attached actuators.
